# Card Landing Page Design

## Task-

- Create a landing page same as [Demo Site](https://38b732f972d36118.demo.carrd.co/)

## Development

Before doing everything, you've install `NodeJS` & `Yarn` first to follow the next steps.

1 - Install the Dependencies
Navigate into your new site’s directory and install Dependencies.

```
yarn
```

2 - Start developing.

```
yarn run start
```

If everything is completely fine, you'll find your site running at http://127.0.0.1:1234/

3 - Production Build

```
yarn run build
```

Once it complete, you'll find all static files into a directory named `dist`

## Let's have a look what's inside!
